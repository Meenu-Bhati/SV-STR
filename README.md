###  "Structural variants (SV) and short tandem repeats (STR) impact gene expression and splicing in bovine testis tissue"

This repository contains multiple workflows and scripts pertaining to the identification and genotyping of Structural Variations (SVs) and Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) through the utilization of short-read sequencing data. Additionally, the repository includes scripts and workflows for e/s QTL discovery using SVs and STRs.

After installing Snakemake and the necessary tools, you can execute all Snakemake workflows by utilizing the "submit***.sh" file in each respective folder. Remember to modify the paths as needed before running the workflows/scripts.
