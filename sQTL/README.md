## Splicing QTL analyses

### 1. Splicing quantification

To conduct splicing quantification as intron excision ratios, utilize the script "Splicing_quantification.sh." 
Make sure to update the file path accordingly.

### 2. Prepare Covariates

 use [Covariates](https://github.com/Meenu-Bhati/SV-STR/blob/main/RNA_quantification/Covariates/) from eQTL analyses and just replace expression (TPM) file with final outout of above script (leafcutter output)
