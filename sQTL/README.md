## Splicing QTL analyses

### 1. Splicing quantification

To conduct splicing quantification as intron excision ratios, utilize the script "Splicing_quantification.sh." 
Make sure to update the file path accordingly.

### 2. Prepare Covariates

use same [Covariates](https://github.com/Meenu-Bhati/SV-STR/blob/main/RNA_quantification/Covariates/) from eQTL analyses and substitute the expression (TPM) file with the final output from the preceding script (leafcutter output), along with the PCA generated using leafcutter.
